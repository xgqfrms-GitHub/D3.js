[Build Interactive JavaScript Charts with D3 v4](https://egghead.io/courses/build-interactive-javascript-charts-with-d3-v4)

> In this course we will learn and demonstrate the fundamental concepts and APIs of D3, on our way to building several common chart types. We’ll start with the building blocks upon which all D3 visualizations are built; things like scales, interpolators, and selections. We’ll see how to load data with D3, and how to put its full name, Data Driven Documents, into action. We’ll build column and bar charts, scatter plots, and area charts. Most importantly, we’ll gain an understanding of the conventions and patterns that underlie all D3 projects and examples, enabling you to dissect, understand, and build virtually any D3 visualization on the internet.
